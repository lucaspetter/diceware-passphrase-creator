## About Diceware Passphrase Creator
Diceware Passphrase Creator helps you create strong, memorable passphrases, such as `CrimpGnarlFewTrenchWaist` or `plum down dizzy 123 egypt foot`, by rolling six-sided dice to randomly select from a set of 7776 possible words. This system is more unpredictable than picking words on your own or trusting computer-generated randomness. It's great for making the master password for a password manager program so you only need to memorize a single strong passphrase. It's also handy for securing wireless networks, disk encryption, PGP email encryption keys, and more. It's based on the [Diceware Wordlist](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) by Arnold Reinhold and best practice [instructions](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/) by Micah Lee.

Here are some more examples of passphrases you can make using this program:
- `Snout Prop Endow Sauce Gogh Venial`
- `chiefnepalsurgedamevokegourd`
- `shall pest fount brine usc doria bates`
- `KinCaineNoisyShredLax,`
- `FeeGripAfricaEngleVivo>2123`

### Strong, memorable passphrases
Long, random passphrases are more secure because they're more difficult for an attacker to guess than simple passwords. While `Batman1989` is easily guessed and `&1KJl6a8y$g*01W}i21!MZ` is too hard to remember, Diceware passphrases like `ChillyDressyDataShakenCrater` are strong and memorable.

### Why use dice?
For selecting words randomly, dice are preferred over computer-generated random numbers because they're a more reliable and transparent source of randomness. If no dice are available, try to get some. If that's not possible, the program can generate pseudo-random numbers instead, although dice are recommended.

### Easy to share and safe to use
The program is designed as a self-contained webpage: it's a single file that doesn't load any external content, which means it's not only safe and private, but also highly compatible and easy to share. Email it to all your friends! You can even use it offline – simply save it on your hard drive and use it whenever a new passphrase is needed.

## Requirements
Diceware Passphrase Creator works on any operating system in modern web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer; Firefox is highly recommended. Make sure you're running the latest version of your web browser in order to have the best security protection.

You will need at least one six-sided die in order to create random passphrases. If you don't have dice, you should try to get some; if that's not possible, the program can generate pseudo-random numbers instead, although dice are highly recommended.
